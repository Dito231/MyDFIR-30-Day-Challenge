ELK Stack Introduction

Objective: Better understanding of what the ELK stack is and the benefits.

E - ELK | Elastic seach

Database to store logs -  WWindows event LOGS, syslogs, firewall logs, etc - you can search accross data with querey language called ESQL.
It also uses REST APIs and JSON.

L - Logstash - pipeline that collects telemetry (Telemetry is the automated process of collecting and transmitting data from remote sources for monitoring and analysis) from different sources. Beats and Elastic agents. 

Types of beats
File Beat - Logs
Metric Beat - Metrics
Packet Beat - Network Data
Winlog Beat - Windows Events
Audit Beat - Audit Data
Heartbeat beat - Uptime monitoring

Another way is the Elastic Agent using 1 unified agent per host. 

What is parsing? Pulling out certain values out of a log and mapping it to a certain name.

K - Kibana 
Query through logs, build dashboards, and Data Exploration. Machine learning, Elastic maps, Alerting etc

Search Data
Create Visualizations
Create Reports
Create Alerts

Elasticsearch = Indexer / Search head

logstash = Heavy Forwarder

Kibana = Web GUI

Beats/Agents = Universal Forwarders

BENEFITS OF USING ELK

1. Centralized Logging - Meet complicance requirements & search data
2. Flexibility - Customized Ingestion
3. Visualizations - Observer information at-a-glace
4. Scalability - Easy to configure to handle larger environments
5. Ecosystems - Many integrations and rich community


BONUS - Many SIEMS are built on the ELK stack.
