SSH into machine. Download Kibana with wget in CLI. dpkg -i [filename.deb].

systemctl start kibana.service
systemctl status kibana.service


Need to generate elastic search enrollment token. -  cd /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin ;   ./elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token --scope kibana

Connection to IP ADDRESS:5601 not working. Firewall rules for the VULTR cloud firewall group need to be managed. Created a role to:  Action( accept)  |   Protocol (TCP)   |  Port(or range)   (1-65535  | Source (MY IP)

Connection to IP ADDRESS:5601 still not working. In vm, we added a firewall rule within VM to let everything coming into the port access with -   ufw allow 5601

SUCCESS!


Elastic needs search enrollment token. Provide from my .txt file. Next, it needs kibana-verification-code. Go to /usr/share/kibana/bin and execute the binary named kibana-verification-code. 
Copy the code into kibana, then sign in with username and password. 

Last config is to add "Keystores"

Go to alerts under security in kibana. It calls for an encryption key so we can delete or modify rules after kibana starts. Find this on vm in kibana-encryption-keys, execute it with "./kibana-encryption-keys generate" and add it to the kibana.yml file.

Find kibana-encryption-keys binary, execute it, copy and paste the 3 values into .txt file and then:

root@DITO-ELK:/usr/share/kibana/bin# ./kibana-keystore add xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey
Enter value for xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: ******************************
root@DITO-ELK:/usr/share/kibana/bin# ./kibana-keystore add xpack.reporting.encryptionKey
Enter value for xpack.reporting.encryptionKey: ******************************
root@DITO-ELK:/usr/share/kibana/bin# ./kibana-keystore add xpack.security.encryptionKey
Enter value for xpack.security.encryptionKey: *********************************

We have successfully installed kibana!
