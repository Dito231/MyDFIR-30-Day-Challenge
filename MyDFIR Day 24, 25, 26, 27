osticket setup tutorial | DAY 24

XAMPP - Apache distribution contining MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. 
Downloaded XAMPP and put the osTicket VM in the 30 Day challenge Firewall group to protect it from the Internet. Next I edited the configuration file named configuration .inc, chose the started apache and MySQL,
clicked admin button and configured settings in phpmyadmin to change the user Domain info online. Then I went back to the config file and changed domain info, including username and password info on both the online portal and 
Config file. 


htdocs folder in xampp, for osticket webdocs


Then went to Osticket and downloaded it. Extracted. Place osticket contents in new created directory folder made in htdocs. Then go to ip address of osticket. http://IPADDRESS/osticket/upload


Went to create osticket installation, but after doing everything, database was not created. Need to go back and create database.
